                <h3>"I'm Marcus Rashford, 23, Black": Racially Abused After Euro 2020 Loss, England Footballer's Powerful Note</h3>

                <p>England star Marcus Rashford shared a heartfelt note on his Twitter handle, apologising for his penalty miss in England's shoot-out loss to Italy in the Euro 2020 final on Sunday. Rashford was among three England players to miss their spot-kicks in the shoot-out, which Italy won 3-2. Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka were all subjected to sickening racial abuse on social media following England's heartbreak. On Monday night, the England star took to Twitter to send out a powerful message, saying "my penalty was not good enough, it should have gone in but I will never apologise for who I am and where I come from".

                    Rashford and Sancho were brought on by England manager Gareth Southgate in the final moments of extra-time in the final, specifically so they could take penalties.
                    
                    But the gamble didn't pay off as both missed from the spot.
                    
                    "A penalty was all I'd been asked to contribute for the team. I can score penalties in my sleep so why not that one? It's been playing in my head over and over since I struck the ball and there's probably not a word to quite describe how it feels," wrote Rashford.</p>

                    Facebook, Twitter said they were taking down racially abusive commentsMembers of the England football team were victims of racial abuseBoris Johnson and other leaders expressed dismay over the online abuse
                    Facebook and Twitter said on Monday they were scrambling to take down racially abusive comments directed at members of the England football team following a heartbreaking loss in Sunday's Euro 2020 final. The US social media giants said they were taking down racist and hateful content which had prompted condemnation from British political leaders. The actions came after a stream of abusive messages on Twitter and Facebook-owned Instagram directed at Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka, the three players who missed England's penalties on Sunday.
                    
                    "The abhorrent racist abuse directed at England players last night has absolutely no place on Twitter," said a spokesperson for the San Francisco-based short messaging service.
                    
                    "In the past 24 hours, through a combination of machine learning based automation and human review, we have swiftly removed over 1,000 Tweets and permanently suspended a number of accounts for violating our rules -- the vast majority of which we detected ourselves proactively using technology. "
                    
                    Facebook said earlier in a statement it had "quickly removed comments and accounts directing abuse at England's footballers last night and we'll continue to take action against those that break our rules".</p>

                <h3>England Hit With Multiple Charges By UEFA After Wembley Fan Clashes</h3>

                <p>European football body, UEFA on Tuesday charged England on four different offences relating to fans' misbehaviour during Euro 2020 final clash between England and Italy. Italy ended England's dream to win the Euro 2020 here at the Wembley Stadium on Sunday (local time). Azzurri defeated England 3-2 on penalties after the normal 90-minute action had finished at 1-1 and even extra time was not able to break the deadlock. Rashford, Jadon Sancho, and Bukayo Saka all missed the chance to net goals in the penalty shootouts.

                    The English players were then abused on social media.
                    
                    Before the match at Wembley, fans engaged in brawls and some also tried to enter Wembley Stadium without tickets. After the match, a scuffle also broke out between the supporters inside and around the stadium.
                    
                    "Disciplinary proceedings have been opened following the UEFA EURO 2020 final match between the national teams of Italy and England (1-1, Italy won 3-2 on penalties), played on July 11 at Wembley Stadium, London," UEFA said in a statement.
                    
                    The charges are as follows:
                    
                    Invasion of the field of play by its supporters - Article 16(2)(a) of the UEFA Disciplinary Regulations (DR)
                    
                    Throwing of objects by its supporters - Article 16(2)(b) DR
                    
                    Disturbance caused by its supporters during the national anthem - Article 16(2)(g) DR
                    
                    Lighting of a firework by its supporters - Article 16(2)(c) DR
                    
                    In its statement, UEFA added: "The case will be dealt with by the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body (CEDB) in due course. Separately, and in accordance with Article 31(4) DR, a UEFA Ethics and Disciplinary Inspector has been appointed to conduct a disciplinary investigation into events involving supporters which occurred inside and around the stadium."</p>
